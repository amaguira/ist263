    Aminata Maguiraga
    I am an Information Management and Technology major at Syracuse University, where I am particularly interested in exploring the intersection of data, technology, and user experience. My goal is to apply these skills in consulting roles, helping organizations solve complex problems and enhance their technological strategies.
    Throughout my academic journey, I have honed skills in communication, organization, and teamwork through my role as a library monitor at Bird Library. This position has not only provided financial support but also allowed me to develop a keen understanding of effective customer service and operational efficiency. Networking played a key role in securing this job, a lesson I value deeply.
    Outside of work and academics, I enjoy organizing fun, interactive events with my friends, like building gingerbread houses a quirky tradition that reflects my creative and social side. In my downtime, I appreciate engaging TV shows, movies, and books, always looking for stories that spark inspiration or provide a good laugh.
    With a passion for both technology and meaningful human interaction, I’m excited to continue growing and taking steps toward a fulfilling career in consulting.
